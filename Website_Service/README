- Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Design a simple developer service website with descriptions of skills and interests
- For the requirements, I used basic HTML structure to insert all content, more than three CSS selectors to design the layout, and one JavaScript action to trigger an action (“Making an appointment”)
- Upload the files to  GitHub, screenshot the commits and provide link of GitHub
- Here's the link
